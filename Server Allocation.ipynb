    "All right, but there is far too much symetry because are solvers are the same, so a linear solver will spend a lot of time looking for the optimal solution because they are virtually all worth the same. A way to break the symetry is to introduce an increasing cost for each new server. This way the server $n$ is going to cost more than the server $n-1$, which is going to cost more than the server $n-2$... So instead of minimizing $\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j$, we minimize e.g. $\\sum_{j=1}^n j y_j$."
